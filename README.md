Digital Electronics Final Project Kiana Lee


## Project Overview
The ASL Hand Project is an ongoing engineering and research project that explores the design of a robotic hand capable of producing American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling.

  At its current stage, the project focuses on:
```
    System design and planning
    Servo control experiments
    Power, wiring, and communication testing
    Software development and troubleshooting
```
The physical robotic hand has **not yet been fully assembled**, and this repository documents the _design process, experimentation_, and _preparation_ leading up to a full build.

## Project Objectives
```
Design a robotic hand system capable of ASL fingerspelling
Develop Python-based control logic for multi-servo coordination
Test and validate servo drivers, power delivery, and timing
Document all engineering decisions in a reproducible manner
Prepare a system architecture that can be physically assembled in future work
```

American Sign Language is a complete visual language that is often underrepresented in engineering applications. This project aims to explore how robotic systems could support ASL education and accessibility through careful, respectful design.

As a Deaf/Hard-of-Hearing student, this project is motivated by both **technical curiosity and personal experience** with accessibility in STEM. 

## Digital Notebook (Primary Documentation)

This project is supported by a detailed Digital Notebook, which serves as the **official technical record**. 
The Digital Notebook includes the following:
```
Design planning and system architecture
Software testing and troubleshooting steps
Servo control experiments and parameters tested
Power and wiring analysis
Calibration attempts and limitations
Links to external resources used for decision-making
Screenshots, diagrams, graphs, and code excerpts
```
The notebook is structured so that all work can be reviewed, followed, and replicated by others. 

You can access the notebook with the following link:
